# UK Sound Replacement
A mod that allows you to make and use soundpacks to replace the sounds in Ultrakill. The mod does not come with any sound packs, so make sure to download those yourself.

# Creating a soundpack
The mod comes with a template soundpack that is empty, and can be used to create your own. In order for a sound to be loaded into your soundpack, you should place the corresponding sound into the correct folder, for example if you want to be sound to be played when the Railcannon is charged then put it in RailcannonSounds\RailcannonChargedSounds, supported file types are .mp3, .ogg, and .wav. The .uksr file stores the name of your soundpack, and will not be loaded if the name is "Template" or "Stock". If you want your soundpack to have a preview image, drop a 256x256 px image called "preview.png" into the same directory your .uksr file is. Please note that changing the folder structure of a soundpack will cause the mod to break, so don't do that.
